# Deep Learning AI Transformers and Forecasting
A repository for the Foresight Jounal Article - _Deep Learning and Transformer Forecasting in a Retail Environment â€“ Is it worth it_?

The repository contains files to replicate the outcomes presented in the article. The code is in Python Jupyter Notebooks. 
It was developed using the DARTS automated forecasting package which includes traditional simplistic forecasting models, 
machine learning models, deep learning models, and transformer models. The code utilizes Pytorch AI capabilities. It
was developed in a MAC silicon (i.e., M-series chips) environment, which requires sepecific setup to utilize the 
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) in that environment. The code has been tested in a Windows environment and runs effectively.

The Python version utilized was 3.11. A requirements.txt file includes all of the package versions included in the
envrionment.
